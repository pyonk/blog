This stunning sunset was captured from the observation deck of Tokyo Tower. The golden hour lighting created this beautiful silhouette of the city skyline. The weather was perfect, with clear skies allowing for an unobstructed view of the horizon.

I used a telephoto lens to compress the perspective and make the sun appear larger in the frame. The exposure was carefully balanced to retain detail in both the highlights and shadows.
